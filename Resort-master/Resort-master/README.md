# Resort
Computer graphics project.
The main aim of our project is to demonstrate “SCENARIO OF RESORT”, which includes the rotation of flying saucer(saucer plane) and boat in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions. Both saucer plane and boat rotate in the same direction. Interactions has been provided using mouse (through the use of menus). We have implemented this project using OpenGL and Microsoft Visual C++.
