HAWK-EYE

	The main aim of this project is to visualize a Hawk-Eye system in OpenGL. The main tasks include moving the ball in a desired direction and making it to pitch on the desired position by clicking the mouse left and right buttons respectively, inculcating the features of mouse interfacing. Pitching the ball on the LBW reference line makes the bails, on the wickets at the striker end, to disappear indicating that the ball has pitched inside and the batsman is out. The OpenGL graphics package is aimed at supporting the requirement of the computer graphics package. The editor has been implemented under the OPENGL environment using the C as the language tool.
